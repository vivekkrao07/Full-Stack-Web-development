# Full-Stack-Web-development
This project is a simple recipe management web app built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a Node.js backend. It allows users to view, manage, and store recipes using an SQLite database. The backend is powered by Express, with CORS enabled for frontend communication, and uses SQLite3 for database operations.
